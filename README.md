Question 1 multiples consecutive integers using a while loop until the product exceeds the threshold value

Question 2 Uses a for loop to create a dictionary containing a string as the key, with the value as another dictionary. The first key as "length" and the numerical length as the value, and the second key "parity" and if the length of the string is "even" or "odd" as the second value.

Question 3 Uses a function that takes pairs of integers as a parameter(x,y), and computes x**y by using a for loop.

Question 4 Takes in a random list and random key value. Using list methods and a for loop. The sorted list is printed, the random key value is printed and, the first matching index from the list is printed.

Question 5 Uses a function that takes two radii as its parameters. It validates the input, computes the area of the circle from the given radii, and computes the percentage that the area of the smaller circle overlaps the area of the larger circle.

Question 6 Uses a function that takes in a list as its parameter. The function then creates a dictionary using for loops. The keys in the dictionary are unique integers from the list and the corresponding values are the percentage of elements in the list that are less than or equal to that key.

Question 7 Uses a function that takes in a number of seconds past midnight, and converts the time into hours,minutes and seconds. The function also indicates whether the time past is in the AM or PM.

Question 8 Creates a data set using four different lists embedded in a dictionary. The last column in the data set is created from multiplying column "A" by column "B". The data set is created using the pandas library.
